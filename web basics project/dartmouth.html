            <h3>dartmouth archives</h3>
        
        <p>
            My journey in the field of archives began at Rauner Special 
            Collections Library at Dartmouth College. The summer of 2022, 
            I was did archival research at the library through Dartmouth's 
            Historical Accountability Student Research Program, which "offers 
            research opportunities for Dartmouth undergraduates to explore primary 
            sources in our collections related to issues of diversity and 
            inclusion in Dartmouth history." As a queer student studying English literature, 
            I wanted to look into Dartmouth's queer history through the lens of 
            works of fiction published in campus literary magazine.

            <ul>
                <li>Uncovered over 50 stories from Dartmouth’s literary magazines with queer themes by analyzing 40 years’ worth of material.</li>
                <li>Considered the uncovered stories alongside College records that exposed nonnormative Dartmouth cultures – i.e. the recordsof President Hopkins, student theses, and the letters of Clifford Orr, class of 1922 – to gain a clearer image of student life.</li>
                <li>Developed an interactive website and public presentation to promote community knowledge of Dartmouth queer history.</li>

           After this research project, I knew I could not go back to the life I had before working in an archive, so I began working as a student assistant in the library. I worked with Jay Satterfield, Head of Rare Books and Special Collections.

        During my senior year, I also took various classes that involved work at Rauner Library. These classes included History of the Book, a critical museum studies class, and two others that culminated in digitial exhibits. You can find the exhibits for these two classes below.

                The below images all come from the digital exhibit and are photos that you can find at Rauner Library. The first is a photo of Dartmouth Christian Union members in 1957. Traynham is pictured 5th from left on the top row. The other two images are of articles written by Traynham.
