            Hello! My name is Sabrina Simon. Welcome to my website! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am an aspiring archivist, and I am currently working as an archives research assistant while also pursuing 
            my Masters in Library and Information Sciences. I grew up on Long Island, and I have been living and working 
            in New York City for the past two years, since graduating from Dartmouth College in June 2023.   
        </p>
        
        <h4>
        Archives Research
        </h4>
        
        <p>
            I am currently the archives research assistant in the archives at the General Service Office (GSO) of Alcoholics 
            Anonymous World Services, Inc. My role at the archives largely 
            sits at the intersection of research and reference work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the missions of the GSO Archives is to <em>"make the history of the organization accessible to A.A. 
            members and other researchers."</em> Because of this, the archives team receives hundreds of research requests a 
            month from A.A. members living across the United States and Canada, and even around the world. However, 
            the sensitive nature of much of the materials housed in the archives means that we are unable to distribute 
            a majority of materials, even those that are already digitized. Rather, we respond to the majority of 
            requests with highly researched reference letters that reference information found in documents in our 
            collections. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Common requests relate to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Group Histories (i.e. information about local A.A. Groups)</li>
            <li>A.A. literature</li>
            <li>Information on founding members</li>
            <li>Organizational structure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As the research assistant, I spend a majority of my time researching and answering reference requests. However, I am also currently involved in a series of long term preservation and digitization projects.

        LIS Student
        </h4>
        
        <p>
            I am currently in my first semester of my MS, Library and Information Sciences program at Pratt Institute, School of Information, 
            where I am planning to also get an advanced certificate in Archives. I am currently enrolled in the following classes:        
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Foundations of Information Science</li>
            <li> Information Technology</li>
            <li> Reference and Instruction</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>
        Queer History
        </h4>
        <p>
            I was initially drawn to work in the archives to uncover stories of queer life across history. 
            I am particularly interested in the periods of history when non-normative experiences were 
            explicitly left out of and intentionally erased from the Archives. For so much of history, and even
            today in places around the world, most of the evidence we have of queer life comes from records of 
            criminality and pathology.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But what about stories of queer life, love, and joy?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My first archival project was born out of asking this question. As a queer student on Dartmouth's campus, I 
            was curious about what life may have looked like for students at a time when many did not understand their own
            non-normative desires, and even for those who did, it was not safe for them to be out. I imagined the history of queer life 
            on campus prior to 1950 by analyzing works of fiction published in campus literary magazines, seeking stories 
            with queer themes. Through this research, I uncovered over 50 such stories. Learn more about this project

        </p>
    
        <p>
            I am currently seeking ways to engage with queer archives in New York City to continue this important work!
